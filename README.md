1D unconstrained optimization

a functioning one-dimensional black box unconstrained function optimizer, that is, an optimizer of real-valued functions f(x) of one real-valued argument x using only function calls that evaluate f(x) 
but no information about derivatives df/dx, d^2f/dx^2, etc., 
and no further constraints on the argument x. 
Here “functioning” just means it always produces some numerical answer.!
