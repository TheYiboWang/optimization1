1D Unconstrained Optimization

A functioning one-dimensional black box unconstrained function optimizer, that is, an optimizer of real-valued functions f(x) of one real-valued argument x using only function calls that evaluate f(x) but no information about derivatives df/dx, d^2f/dx^2, etc., and no further constraints on the argument x. 

Code is tested on two different 1D unconstrained optimization problems f(x), with optimization starting points drawn from a probability distribution which user choose and document.
